<p>My name is Glordens Cenat and I am originally from the beautiful island Haiti. I grew up in a family of seven children and I am the 3rd child. I am a father of 3 beautiful girls who are the very reason I went back to college not only to have a career but also to set an example to them.  </p>

<p>I am passionate about studying and love to learn new things to acquire more knowledge. As a citizen of the world, I believe it is exceptionally important to know something about everthing as little as it may be. I left Haiti with in 2008 with a Bachelor Degree in Religious Studies and a Certificate of ESL which prompted me to tackle life once arrived to the land of opportunity. I did not see myself going back to school right away, which was by the way a mistake. I needed to work to take care of my family. After a few years here in america, I continued with my religious studies at New York Theological Seminary but had to drop out because of the program was becomning too expensive. After I moved to the Garden State, I wanted to go on a different path and enrolled at Union County College where I got my Associate Degree in Computer Science. Because of the love I have for Technology and how It has evolved over the years, I transferred to Kean University and about to graduate with Bachelor Degree in Information Technology.</p>

<p>This website is my first project in Web Development and and I already see myself in the web development industry and data science. after graduation, I plan on conitnuing my education in Technology going for either a Master's Degree in Computer Information Systems or Digital Design.</p>
